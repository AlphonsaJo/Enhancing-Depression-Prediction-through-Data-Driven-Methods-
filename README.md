# Enhancing Depression Prediction through Data-Driven Methods

Depression is a widespread mental health issue requiring precise and timely predictions for effective treatment. This project presents a hybrid model combining Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We evaluate the models with and without Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address risks in medical datasets.

## Results

The hybrid model, which combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with SMOTE augmentation, achieved a remarkable test accuracy of **93%**. In comparison, the model without SMOTE achieved **88.4%** accuracy. These findings underscore the efficacy of the hybrid model and emphasize the importance of addressing class imbalance in medical datasets to enhance prediction accuracy.
